A simple reddit bot that searches comments for misspellings of a word 'python' on a /r/learnpython subreddit.

You need to create set up your own account, download praw and configure praw.ini to use the code.

Bot only sends a message to itself because sending a lot of automated messages to other users might violate sitewide rules.
